
Achieved Tasks:

*Display frame meter : In GridScript class a new method OnGUI is added to display the fps in the left top corner. 
*Create a trash can and import it in Unity environment.
*Create new types of round-about 2 types and create a new type of road(two lanes).
*Place all object on the ground and scale them respectively.
*Place fountain in the center of the round-about.
*Let objects be placed in the right way in the virtual world like attach to them scripts sidewalks and postlights. 


Problems Faced
*Difficulties with reading the code and understanding it.
*Difficulties with the Ray-Cast and the different layers on the grid.
*Textures used instead of buttons which is harder as they use textures names and tags to check if the textures is called.


Future Ideas
*Recreating the grid so the object takes the appropriate number of cells.
*Road object take 2 cells instead of 1. New bends can be created in such way.
*Let the left mouse button edit the different road objects as they are on the grid.
*Let the right mouse button place simple type of roads(no signs or postlights).
*Use buttons and event handlers instead of textures.
