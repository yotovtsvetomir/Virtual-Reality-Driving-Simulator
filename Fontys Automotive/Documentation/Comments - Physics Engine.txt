# VPT1 - Personal Comments

Ashish Kumar & Konstantin Indjov

## Work Done:

- Developed a new physics engine for DriveSim. Currently, the engine is concerned with turning at constant forward velocity.

## Current Bugs:

The X-Y translation of the velocities is not calculated properly. This results in the radius of curvature being smaller than desired.

## Notes

- The implementation for the calculation of forces and velocities are accurate, so the only problem lies in the translation into real X-Y coordinates.
- All calculations are performed with fixed constant values. These were provided to us by Roel (project leader). For reference, check the MatLab files.
- When the project is integrated with Unity, we might need to change the time step and forward velocity to accommodate to the scale of the world.

## Problems Faced:

- This was the first time we worked with a MatLab model.
- The integration is done differently for different parts of the calculations, which took time to figure out.

## Future Ideas:

- Implement forward acceleration
- Currently the simulation is being tested in a WinForms test app. It should work with Unity.
- Write unit tests to speed up development and reduce time spent on testing.
